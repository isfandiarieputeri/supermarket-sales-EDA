# supermarket-sales-EDA
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. (IBM Cloud Education, 2020)

In this project, I explore Supermarket sales data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) using some basic functions on pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot. EDA seems so basic, but it often can give us a piece of big information from our data. It also helps us to dive deeply into our data characteristics.
